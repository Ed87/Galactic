This is the main project for the Galactic API. It uses the SharedLibraries project as a central place to put built DLLs and access third-party libraries necessary for the project but not availble via NuGet.

This repository should generally be placed at the same level in the directory structure as the SharedLibraries project.

For example:

If you place the SharedLibraries project in: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\SharedLibraries
then this project should be placed in: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Galactic

Build Requirements:

To accomodate automatic assembly versioning, this solution requires that the following be installed:

Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 SDK - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758

Modeling SDK for Visual Studio 2013 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40754

If they are not installed, automatic assembly versioning will not work, but the solution should otherwise
build normally.
